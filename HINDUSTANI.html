    <h1 >HINDUSTANI MUSIC</h1>
    <h2> ABOUT</h2>
   <p> Hindustani classical music is the classical music of northern regions of the Indian subcontinent. It may also be called North Indian classical music or, in Hindustani, Shastriya Sangeet. The term shastriya sangeet literally means classical music, and can also mean Indian classical music in general.[1] It is played on instruments like the veena, sitar and sarod. Its origins from the 12th century CE, when it diverged from Carnatic music, the classical tradition in South India. While Carnatic music largely uses compositions produced in Sanskrit, Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and sometimes in Malayalam, Hindustani music largely uses compositions written in Hindi, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Urdu, and Braj Bhasha.</p>
