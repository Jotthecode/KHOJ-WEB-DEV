    <h1 >BOLLYWOOD POP MUSIC</h1>
    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
   <p> Bollywood music was born in 1931 with the advent of India’s first sound motion film, Alam Ara by Ardeshir Irani, which featured seven songs. It was during this time that the seeds of the new musical genre were sown. The film was closely followed by Jamshedji Framji Madan’s Shirheen Farhad (1931), which featured 42 song sequences</p>
