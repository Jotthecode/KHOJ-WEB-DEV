    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
 <p>   Lavani (Marathi: लावणी) is a genre of music popular in Maharashtra, India.[1] Lavani is a combination of traditional song and dance, which particularly performed to the beats of Dholki, a percussion instrument. Lavani is noted for its powerful rhythm. Lavani has contributed substantially to the development of Marathi folk theatre.[2] In Maharashtra and southern Madhya Pradesh it is performed by the female performers wearing nine-yard long sarees. The songs are sung in a quick tempo.</p>
